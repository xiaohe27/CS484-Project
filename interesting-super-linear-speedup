Hypothesis:

the sequential algorithm is executed in the beginning.
so it remains a lot of caches, which can be used in the later mpi algorithm.

In a setting of 3 computing nodes, with 12 cores per node, the sequential algorithm is
performed by the process 0, which is located in one of the computing node. So in the 
later mpi algorithm's execution, there will be at least 12 processes in the computing node
 where sequential algorithm was performed getting advantages of the caches.
